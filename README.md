# SpotifySearch


A simple web app written using Jinja2 framework.

It's main use case is using Spotify API to perform searches on it's database.

We can select a filter used during a search (artist, album, track or playlist) and the app asks Spotify using an API call about what we wanted to search.

In addition to this simple use case another useful feature was implemented: when searching for album or track we can click on the picture next to the found record to hear a preview of the album.

The app may or may not contain subliminal messaging.
